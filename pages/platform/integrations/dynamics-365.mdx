4.  A pop-up will open, allowing you to turn on contact auto sync between your Wave and Dynamics 365 accounts. We recommend leaving this on. Press '**Continue**.'

      **Note**: Your Wave contacts will automatically sync as '**Contacts**' in your Dynamics 365 account.
    </Callout>

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰, you have successfully integrated Dynamics 365 in your Wave account.

### Contact Owner Assignment:

Wave Connect automatically assigns Lead/Contact owner based on the creator's email. If the email does not match with any Dynamics 365 user, the default value specified in your Dynamics 365 account applies.
