# Zapier

## Introduction

In this document, we provide a step-by-step guide on how users can integrate Zapier in their Wave account to sync contacts and lead across Zapier ecosystem.

## Integrating Salesforce in your Wave account

1.  [Login](https://app.wavecnct.com/login) to your Wave user account
2.  Go to Settings, then click on Integrations.
3.  Click on the '**Connect**' button.<br /><br />

    <br />

4.  Copy your API key to your clipboard by clicking on the copy icon, and click on '**Continue**'. A new [tab](https://zapier.com/apps/wave-connect/integrations) will open, directing you to the Zapier website.<br /><br />

    <br />

5.  On the new page, click on the orange, â€˜**Connect Wave Connect to 6,000+ apps**â€™ button.

6.  You will be directed to a Zap creation page with a preliminary outline of your Zap. Each Zap is made of two separate events:

    **A. Trigger**: an event that starts the automation process (e.g. new contact creation).

    **B. Action**: the automated process performed once the trigger occurs. When trigger happens, action follows.<br /><br/>

## Setting Up Trigger

1. Click on the trigger banner.
2. Under '**App & event**', you can select the event that triggers the automation process, including new contact creation, deletion, and information updates.
   In this guide, we focus solely on new contact creation. Selecting '**New Contact**' ensures any new contact created in your Wave app initiates this Zapier process.
   To do so, map '**\* Event (required)**' to â€˜**New Contact**â€™ and then '**Continue**'.

4. Enter your API key from _step 4_ of <a href="#setting-up-your-first-zap">_Setting Up Your First Zap_</a>. Click on â€˜**Yes, Connect to Wave Connect**.â€™ Afterwards, verify your Wave user account credentials, displayed in the designated area, and press '**Continue**'.<br/><br/>

   <br />

5. Click â€˜**Test trigger**â€™ if you wish to test your trigger with a contact already in your Wave contactâ€™s list. Select a contact that you wish to perform your test with and click on â€˜**Continue with selected record**.â€™<br/><br/>

## Setting Up Action

1. Find the action banner below the trigger banner. After clicking on the banner, you will choose among various apps, each offering various tasks and services. For this demo, select '**Google Sheets**' app to track newly created contacts.<br/><br/>

   <Callout type="info">
     **Note**: If the action banner does not exist in your Zap outline, you can add it by clicking on the plus icon
     below the trigger banner.
   </Callout>

   <br />

3. Sign-in and authenticate your Google account then '**Continue**'.
4. Under the Action tab:<br/>
   A. Select â€˜**My Google Drive**â€™ for your Drive.<br/><br/>

   <br />

   B. Select the spreadsheet that you want to add your contact information to.<br/><br/>

   <img src="/select-spreadsheet.png" alt="Choose Your Spreadsheet" width="500px" />
   <br />

   <Callout type="info">
     **Note**: the sheet you select for this step should already exist in your Google Sheets account (visit [How to
     Create a
     Spreadsheet](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6000292?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#:~:text=Open%20the%20Sheets%20home%20screen,and%20open%20your%20new%20spreadsheet)
     to learn how to create a new spreadsheet on Google Sheets).
   </Callout>

   C. Select a sheet from your spreadsheet that you want your information transcribed to.<br/><br/>

   <img src="/select-sheet.png" alt="Choose Desired Sheet" width="300px" />
   <br />

   <Callout type="info">
     **Note**: Zapier uses the content in the first row of your spreadsheet to map contact information from Wave to the
     columns on your spreadsheet. We recommend choosing appropriate titles in the first row of your spreadsheet (e.g.
     first name, last name, etc.)
   </Callout>

   D. If your sheet is empty, you will receive an error message from Zapier. To circumvent, add headers to the first row of your document and press â€˜Refresh Fieldsâ€™ to load headers from your document. This should display corresponding fields from each cell in the first row of your spreadsheet.<br/><br/>

     src="/no-header-error.png"
     alt="Error Associated With Having No Headers in Your Google Sheets Document"
     width="300px"
   />
   <br />

5. Map '_name_' to '_first name_,' '_surname_' to '_last name_,' '_phone number_' to '_phone_,' '_email_' to '_email_,' and '_location_' to '_city_,' respectively. Once each header is matched with its corresponding info from Wave, click on '**Continue**'. You will then have the option to test your Zap or skip this step altogther.<br/><br/>

   <br />

   <Callout type="info">
     If you choose to test your Zap, Zapier will append Wave contact information directly to your spreadsheet. You can
     review the output in your Google Sheets spreadsheet. If unsatisfied, you can make changes or add additional steps
     as needed.
   </Callout>

6. After confirming your result, click on '**Publish**' to finalize your Zap. Once you publish your Zap, Zapier will append contact information for all contacts on your Wave's contact list to your spreadsheet.

   <Callout type="info">
     **Note**: to avoid duplicates in your spreadsheet, delete test entries before publishing your Zap.{" "}
   </Callout>

7. Congratulations ðŸŽ‰, you just finished configuring and publishing your first Zap! You may now add multiple Zaps with different triggers for contact deletion or information updates as needed by your requirements.
