## Setting Up Trigger

   </Callout>

   C. '**\* Worksheet**' to a sheet from your spreadsheet to transcribed your information to.<br/>

   <Callout type="info">
     **Note**: Zapier uses the content in the first row of your spreadsheet to map contact information from Wave to the
     columns on your spreadsheet. We recommend choosing appropriate titles in the first row of your spreadsheet (e.g.
     first name, last name, etc.)
   </Callout>
   <br />

5. Press â€˜Refresh Fieldsâ€™ to load headers from your document. If your sheet is empty, you will receive the following error message.<br/><br/>
